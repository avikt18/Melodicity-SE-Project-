# Melodicity-SE-Project
Our project Melodicity is a music label and music web streaming platform which is a web-based application built around a single server that handles all the major processing. It will act as a platform for the creators to share their music and apply for the record labels approvals and it also provides listeners with a place to discover new genres of music.
